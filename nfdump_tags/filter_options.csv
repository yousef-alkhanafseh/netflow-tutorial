Date flow start,Start time flow first seen. ISO 8601 format including miliseconds.
Duration,Duration of the flow in seconds and miliseconds.  If  flows  are  aggregated, duration is the time span over the entire periode of time from first seen to last seen.
Proto,Protocol used in the connection.
Src IP Addr:Port, Source IP address and source port.
Dst  IP  Addr:Port, Destination IP address and destination port.  In case of ICMP, port is decodes as type.code.
Flags, TCP flags ORed of the connection.
Tos, Type of service.
Packets, The number of packets in this flow. If flows are aggregated, the packets are summed up.
Bytes,  The number of bytes in this flow. If flows are aggregated, the bytes are summed up.
pps, The calculated packets per second: number of packets /  duration. If  flows  are aggregated this results in the average pps during this periode of time.
bps,  The  calculated  bits  per  second: 8 * number of bytes / duration. If flows are aggregated this results in the average bps during this periode of time.
Bpp, The calculated bytes per packet: number of bytes / number of packets. If flows are aggregated this results in the average bpp during this periode of time.
Flows, Number of flows. If flows are listed only, this number is alwasy 1. If flows are aggregated, this shows the number of aggregated flows to one record.
